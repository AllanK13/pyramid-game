# Pyramid Game — One-Pager
### Working Title: _Pyramid Tycoon: Rise of Stone_

---

## Core Loop

1. **Tap Stone → Shape into Block**  
   Player taps a rough stone repeatedly to sculpt it into a clean, finished block. When complete, the block is added to the Block Stack.

2. **Build Pyramid Base**  
   Once enough blocks exist, the player taps **Assemble Pyramid** to convert them into a Small Pyramid.

3. **Scale Up Production**  
   - Hire **Stone Carvers** to sculpt stones automatically  
   - Hire **Builders** to assemble blocks into pyramids  
   - Helpers can level up, improve speed, or hire junior helpers

4. **Upgrade to Larger Pyramids**  
   Combine small → medium → large → mega pyramids.  
   Higher-tier helpers are needed to build higher-tier pyramids.

5. **Hierarchy of Labor**  
   Carver → Shaper → Builder → Foreman → Architect → Grand Architect  
   Higher ranks manage lower ranks. The player always sits on top as the “Supreme Pharaoh.”
